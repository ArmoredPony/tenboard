# Tenboard

This crate describes a specific keyboard of 10 keys (hence **Tenboard**)
where each key is assigned to one of the 10 fingers, and multiple performance
metrics to test layouts with.
The purpose of this crate is to provide data types to be used in search of the
most efficient layout for such keyboard.

This crate also provides description of [ASETNIOP](https://asetniop.com)
10-key keyboard layout. It is planned to compare Tenboard efficiency against
ASETNIOP.
